# Ticket-sell-website
This is a university project for which I developed the backend for a web application.
The project was done with 3 more colleagues who worked on the front end. 
The web application has the following functionalities: user creation and authentication
using JWT tokens, search events by different attributes such as names, and categories, 
and the possibility to create a cart that contains multiple tickets for various events.
